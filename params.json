Usually OpenSCASA system is accompanied by next\r\ndocumentation:\r\n - AboutOpenSCADA.pdf: Contain the generic information about system.\r\n - DAQ.pdf: Data acquisition conception OpenSCADA.\r\n - APIOpenSCADA.pdf: Contain OpenSCADA system API for developers.\r\n - FAQ.pdf: Frequently ask questions about system.\r\n - Modules/*: Module's documentation directory.\r\n - release_*.pdf: The release preview document for last version.\r\n - openscada.pdf: Generic program description document.\r\n\r\nFor OpenSCADA starting you should write shell command <# openscada>. The system will be started in default configuration.\r\nThis mode not have one DB configuration, but data into the configuration file enough for:\r\n - working into the graphical configurator UI.QTCfg;\r\n - working into WEB-configurators (adress: http://localhost:10002 or http://localhost:10004)\r\n\r\nDefault configuration you can use for demon mode run. For starting the system into demon(server) mode you should write shell command\r\n<# service oscadad start>.\r\n\r\nFor first experience getting you can use OpenSCADA demo package (ModelsDB.AGLKS). This package contain DB with the system and subsystems\r\nconfiguration examples. For starting into demo configurations you should write shell command <# openscada_demo>.\r\n\r\nTo create your own independent configuration SCADA-system user has a run OpenSCADAs putting data in user's home directory (~/.openscada).\r\nFor starting user's configurations you should write shell command <# openscada_start>.\r\n\r\nFor using the system you can need passwords. Default configuration have next users:\r\n - root: system administrator, have password: \"openscada\";\r\n - user: unprivileged user, have password: \"user\".\r\n\r\nIf you have some questions then apply to WWW project's site http://oscada.org for more information.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
